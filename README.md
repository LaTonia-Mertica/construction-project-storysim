# CONSTRUCTION PROJECT STORYSIM

**WHO:**<br>
MENTEE [La'Tonia Mertica](https://www.latoniamertica.dev/), arrant curiosity<br>
MENTOR [Chris](), genius code deconstruction

**WHAT:**<br>
a _passion project_ conceptualizing project-based learning activities through which mentees - enhanced with mentor guidance - research topics about which they are passionate, inspired, motivated to continue their creative journey... a passion project encourages creativity...promotes perseverance, problem solving, and innovation...

<br>
<br>
**and, logistically speaking,** this journey culminates in the application of technical skills learned, breathing life into an idea

**WHEN:**<br>
mentees seldom if ever sleep while materializing their passion project. we are often flush with ideas. startled awake with _try this debug_ and _fine tune that_ thoughts. naively convincing and unconvincing then re-convincing ourselves we can do much much more than is sane on the allotted time table. mentors are zealously lulled along, anchoring the journey in encouragement, expertise, and sensibility...

**WHERE:**<br>
for me, this cohort, given the weather and available resources - my car, my favorite public library, ...and in my dreams where my code ceaselessly executes in vivid error-free session after session

##### **note:** Chris and I discussed the use of artificial intelligence in code/web dev in general and this project.We learned we share some thoughts about the topic, and we agreed to approach this project without it

**WHY:**
why not. seriously, who doesn't have a chance to code or develop a website and accept. personally, my life has presented a series of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. joining this cohort gave me something positive to look forward to, motivated me to at least try, and introduced me to my mentor - who has graciously been more than a support in code/web dev

**NEXT STEPS:**

- rest for a bit
- fine tune mvp
- update trello
- outline next sprint
- schedule to start
